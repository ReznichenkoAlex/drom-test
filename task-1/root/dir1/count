2 Today at the gym, I lifted weights totaling about 135 pounds, feeling the burn as I pushed through my last set. Afterwards, I hit the treadmill, aiming for a speed of 7.5 miles per hour, and managed to keep up for a solid 20 minutes. My heart rate peaked at around 175 beats per minute, but I felt energized rather than exhausted. Later, I met up with friends for lunch and split the bill, each of us paying approximately $25. The food was delicious, and I savored every bite of my $12 burger. Overall, it was a great day filled with activity and good company
